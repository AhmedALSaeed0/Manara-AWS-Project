## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **highly available** and **scalable web application** on AWS using key infrastructure components such as **EC2**, **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, and **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**. It follows AWS best practices to ensure performance, reliability, security, and cost-efficiency.

---

## üß± Architecture Summary

The infrastructure is based on **EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)** and includes:

- **EC2 Instances** for the web and application tiers.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute HTTP traffic across AZs.
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to automatically increase or decrease EC2 instances based on demand.
- **Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** deployed in **Multi-AZ** for fault-tolerant data storage.
- **IAM Roles** to securely grant permissions to EC2 instances and services.
- **Amazon CloudWatch & SNS** to monitor system metrics and send notifications.
- **Amazon Route 53**, **Internet Gateway**, and **NAT Gateway** for DNS resolution and internet access within the VPC.

## üîó How the Services Are Linked Together

Here‚Äôs how all the AWS components interact to build a secure and scalable architecture:

1. **User requests (HTTP/HTTPS)** come through **Route 53** which resolves the domain name and routes traffic to the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
2. The **ALB**, deployed in public subnets, forwards the traffic to **EC2 instances in the Web Tier** (within private or public subnets), managed by a **Web Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**.
3. The **Web EC2 instances** may connect to a separate **App Tier** (also managed by another **ASG**) if the application is multi-layered.
4. Both the **Web** and **App EC2 instances** may connect to the **Amazon RDS** database, which is hosted in **private subnets** across two AZs for high availability.
5. **CloudWatch** monitors CPU utilization, latency, and other metrics. When thresholds are breached, **Auto Scaling Groups** launch or terminate instances automatically.
6. **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** sends email or SMS alerts based on CloudWatch alarms.
7. **IAM Roles** are attached to EC2 instances to grant secure access to services like CloudWatch, S3, or RDS‚Äîwithout using static credentials.
8. **NAT Gateways** provide internet access to instances in private subnets (for OS/package updates).
9. **Internet Gateway** allows outbound internet traffic from public subnets.
